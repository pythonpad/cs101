# Introduction

This course is about **programming** and **computational thinking**, not about learning a programming language.

Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and very powerful.
- Used in many universities for introductory courses.
- Main language used for web programming at Google.
- Widely used in scientific computation, for instance at
NASA, by mathematicians and physicists.
- Available on embedded platforms, for instance Nokia
mobile phones.
- Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are
written in Python.

Once you learnt programming in one language, it is relatively
easy to learn another language, such as C++ or Java.

## Why are you here?

> Every scientist and engineer must know some programming. It is part of basic education, like calculus, linear algebra, introductory physics and chemistry, or English. (Alan Perlis, 1961)

Computer science is not computer programming. We teach programming to teach **computational thinking**:
- Solving problems (with a computer).
- Thinking on multiple levels of abstraction.  
Decompose a problem into smaller problems.
- A way of human thinking (**not** "thinking like a computer")
- Thinking about recipes (**algorithms**).  
30 years ago the solution to a problem in science or engineering was usually a formula. Today it is usually an algorithm (DNA, proteins, chemical reactions, factory planning, logistics).

## What is a program?

A program is a **sequence of instructions** that solves some problem (or achieves some effect).

For instance: Call your friend on the phone and give her instructions to find your favorite café. Or explain how to bake a cake.

**Instructions** are operations that the computer can already perform.

But we can define **new instructions** and raise the **level of abstraction**!

A program implements an **algorithm** (a recipe for solving a problem).

## What is debugging?

A **bug** is a mistake in a program. **Debugging** means to find the mistake and to fix it.

Computer programs are very complex systems. Debugging is similar to an experimental science: You experiment, form hypotheses, and verify them by modifying your program.

Kinds of errors:
- **Syntax error.** Python cannot understand your program, and
refuses to execute it.
- **Runtime error.** When executing your program (**at runtime**),
your program suddenly terminates with an error message.
- **Semantic error.** Your program runs without error messages,
but does not do what it is supposed to do.

## Why is programming useful?

- 30 years ago, **electrical engineering students** learnt about circuits. Today they learn about embedded systems.
- You can build **a radio** in software.
- **Industrial engineers** program industrial robots. Moreover,
today’s industrial engineers work on logistics—problems that
can only be solved by computer.
- **Modern automobiles** contain thousands of lines of code, and
would not run without microprocessors.
- **Mathematicians** gain insight and intuition by experimenting with
mathematical structures, even for discrete objects such as
groups and graphs.
- **Experimental data** often needs to be reformatted to be analyzed
or reused in different software. Python is fantastic for this
purpose.
- **Experimental data sets** are nowadays too large to be handled
manually.

## Why learn programming?

- If you can only use software that **someone else** made for you, you limit your ability to achieve what you want.
- For instance, digital media is manipulated by software. If you can only use Photoshop, you limit your ability to express yourself.
- Programming gives you freedom.

## Why is programming fun?

Programming is a creative process.

A single person can actually build a software system of the complexity of the space shuttle hardware. Nothing similar is true in any other discipline.

There is a large and active **open-source community**: people who write software in their free time for fun, and distribute it for free on the internet. For virtually any application there is code available that you can download and modify freely.
