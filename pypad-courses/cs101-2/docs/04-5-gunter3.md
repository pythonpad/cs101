# Being Edmund Gunter 3

Modify the program from **Being Edmund Gunter 2** exercise to print a sine curve with `*` characters.

For this time, print out multiple space characters (`' '`) before one `*` character in each line to draw a **line**. 

Draw a sine curve with 26 lines. Print maximum 30 space (`' '`) characters and one `*` character in each line.
