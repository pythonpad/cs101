# CS1: Introduction to Programming

The objective of CS101 is to teach programming skills and computational thinking. The first is important because programming is needed in all areas of science and engineering, although very different programming languages are used. The second is perhaps even more important, as it influences how you go about solving a problem. 

## Python Programming Language

This course uses the programming language Python, a language that was designed to be easy to learn. Python is used by many universities world-wide for teaching introductory programming. It is free, open-source, and multi-platform.

Python is not a toy. Python is the basis for much of the programming at Google (for instance, Python is the original and main framework for the Google App Engine platform). Python is used intensively in numerical computations, for instance at NASA. The numerical Python library supports vectorization and is widely used in scientific computation. 

Python is also the language of choice for various popular web applications (e.g. Instagram, Youtube). Large portions of games (such as Civilization IV) are written in Python. 

Python is becoming the language of choice in mathematics, used for instance by graph algorithm libraries, or various open-source mathematics software systems.
